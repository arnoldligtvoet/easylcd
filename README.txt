ba63 lcd display

Recently I purchased a Wincor Nixdorf BA63 LCD display. This is a display that is normally connected to a cash register, however it's also very usable on Linux boxes to display all kind of non-important stuff...


perl script
I've written a small perl script that takes control of the display. It's pretty basic, but should provide some good clues how to show and scroll text on the display.

You'd need perl and a linux machine to run this script.

display information
The BA63 is a 2x20 display.
